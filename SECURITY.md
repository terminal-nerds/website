## Reporting a vulnerability or breach of privacy rights

If you have found a security issue or have any concerns or doubts regarding
privacy rights, please contact us via email: terminal-nerds@pm.me. We are all
ears, but please, **DO NOT create a GitHub issue for reporting a
vulnerability**.

### Vulnerability Process

1. Your report should be acknowledged within a week _(we are a small team, and
   this project is our hobby, a free-time job)_.

2. The team will investigate and update the issue with relevant information.

    If the team does not confirm the report, no further action will be taken. We
    will inform you back.

    If the team confirms the report, the team will take action to fix it
    immediately:

    1. Commits will be handled in a private repository for review and testing.
    2. Release a new patch version from the private repository.
    3. Write an announcement post disclosing the vulnerability.
