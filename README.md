## 💻 Technology stack

This project uses the following technology stack, and there's short reasoning
as to why these choices.

| Technology                          | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Git logomark] [Git]               | As a core version control tool, because it can be used with [GitHub].                                                                                                                                       |
| ![GitHub logomark] [GitHub]         | As a cloud-based service that helps us store and manage our code, and track and control changes to the code. We also want to utilize all of its [features] to make our project transparent and open-source. |
| ![Node.js logomark] [Node.js]       | As core JavaScript runtime for this project development. It offers stability and a vibrant community collection of packages.                                                                                |
| ![pnpm logomark] [pnpm]             | As primary [Node.js] package manager, because it is fast, efficient, disk-saving, and has a feature - [workspaces] - built-in support for [monorepo] without using third tools.                             |
| ![TypeScript logomark] [TypeScript] | As the primary programming language because it offers a fantastic developer experience thanks to its toolings, typings and helps find possible bugs we may not notice.                                      |
| ![Jest logomark] [Jest]             | As the core JavaScript testing library because it focuses on simplicity and can support any side of our project.                                                                                            |

### Back-End technology stack

| Technology                    | Reason                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Express logomark] [Express] | With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at our disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.                                                            |
| ![mongodb logomark] [MongoDB] | MongoDB’s document data model naturally supports JSON and its expressive query language is simple for developers to learn and use.                                        |
| ![Swagger logomark] [Swagger] | The module can identify the endpoints and automatically capture methods such as to get, post, put, and so on. Then will create API documentation regarding those methods. |

This combination of technologies will allow us to create a CRUD API that will be utilized by the front-end UI.
