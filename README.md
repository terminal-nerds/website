We have this [Security Policy] in place. **Our team treats security issues seriously, as
well as privacy breaches**. If you have noticed something, and you trust your
gut but you're not sure, then this is good enough for us. Please take a look at the
instructions in the [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) file regarding next steps.
