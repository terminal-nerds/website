## 💻 Technology stack

This project uses the following technology stack, and there's short reasoning
as to why these choices.

-   ![Git logomark] [Git]
    As a core version control tool, because it can be used with [GitHub] or
    [GitLab]. In our case, we use **GitHub** and **GitHub Projects**.

    [git]: https://git-scm.com/
    [git logomark]: https://api.iconify.design/simple-icons:git.svg "Git logomark"
    [github]: https://github.com/
    [gitlab]: https://gitlab.com/
    [github projects]: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards

-   ![Node.js logomark] [Node.js]
    The core JavaScript runtime for this project development.

    [node.js]: https://nodejs.org/en/
    [node.js logomark]: https://api.iconify.design/simple-icons:nodejs.svg "Node.js logomark"

-   ![TypeScript logomark] [TypeScript]
    The primary programming language offers a fantastic developer experience thanks
    to its toolings, typings and helps find possible bugs.

    [typescript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
    [typescript logomark]: https://api.iconify.design/simple-icons:typescript.svg "TypeScript logomark"

-   ![pnpm logomark] [pnpm]
    The primary Node.js package manager is fast, efficient, disk-saving, and
    has a feature - [workspaces], a **built-in support for [monorepo] without
    using third tools**.
